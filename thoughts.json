He killed off the Jedi until there were only 2 Jedi and 2 Sith, so balanced in a way. Or, in a different interpretation, this action distabilized the Force since the Sith had more control over the universe. The action that brought balance to the Force was when he, as Vader, killed Palpatine. As u/Sarahneth mentioned, he also brought balance to his pod racer as well, if we're being very literal."},

My previous most viewed post had 0.23k views. To repay a bit for my multiplied Red Sauce Karma, I'll try to summarize most made comments and some good ideas:\n\nMost mentioned: additional physical switches, audio recording got most mentions, WIFI as well, I might as well add GPS to the mix for tablets and smartphones. One redditor even wanted sliding slots to close all ports to keep dirt out of them.\n\nOn the subject of dirt: one redditor mentioned that slots would add nooks and crannies for dirt to accumulate and make them more difficult to clean. A good design without sharp corners would be best. \n\nLaptop lids have gotten smaller and smaller, but in order to be able to fit some sturdy cover you simple have to have a certain amount of millimeters (or whatever fancy crazy measurement system your country uses) to work with. I'm thinking a webcam laying in a shallow indentation combined with a 'mail' slot on the top small border where you could just slide in a made to fit wooden or metal rectangle could work too. That would answer the fears of one smartass Redditor that they could secretly install another tiny webcam on the cover.\n\nFor the webcam users appreciate a led that is hard wired electrically wise with the wire for the cam. Apple has assured some people that's how they build them.\n\nOn the proliferation of laptops with had or have sliding covers: there were different brands that had them about 10 years ago, then slowly without covers became more like the norm, but users have bought recent laptops with covers as well, e.g. Dell Rugged types, some Lenovo models (surprisingly for me, I wonder if they're allowed to sell them in China itself ;-)\n\nA few people were ridiculed years ago for covering their webcam with tape and feel justified now years later.\n\nPeople are demanding covers and physical switches for tablets and smartphones as well. \n\nA lot of people suggested good moves to make in front of my webcam. The idea of creating a pay-per-view website for me to do silly and NSFW stuff has become very attractive. I'll consider a pay with Bitcoin only rate of only 0.00099 per minute. For some I might go lower if they really do install the mirrored ceiling in their bathroom themselves. \n\nI might or I might not get to getting more individual replies out to y'all.  So here's my Cat Tax just to be safe: https://imgur.com/gallery/r7H0r "},

It's just proving you have a grasp of the lowest level. \n\nFor example: the lowest level of understanding Spanish you could say something like \"Hola, come estas?\" While you could be fluent in Spanish, all this demonstrates on it's own is an understanding at the lowest level.\n\n2.Everyone that is saying something else is the lowest level, it's a level, there is room for all other types of low-level comedy like slapstick or dirty jokes. The point is on this low level it doesn't involve much thought.  A pun is just a step above rhyming (in my opinion). It's basic word association. Everyone likes it because basically everyone can do it (in their native language). This is why you don't see stand up comedians (at least any good ones) going up and spouting off puns as their entire act, you can work them in as it is a comedic tool, but it is not the be-all and end-all."},

In this setting offspring output would be in-series, though.\n\n* I was not implying that children will be identical (read again). ELI5: The large majority of siblings with same biological parents (full siblings) are not identical, but they share (on average) 50% DNA. This 50% sharing can happen with the setting the post described.\n\n* As pointed out below it gets weirder when two sets of identical twins form two couples. We can take it a step further, if any of this is truth, generalizing for monozygotic twins, triplets, etc.\n\n* For every comment I got saying it was an obvious/silly remark I received another one saying that I failed basic HS biology. In an attempt to confirm the validity of this claim I approached a colleague that works on this topic for a living. This person came back with an unsatisfyingly complicated \"yes but no\" answer that I will not replicate here. I will update this post if I learn a more concise explanation, but for now it would be safe to assume that it is possible to tell children's twin parents apart beyond traditional DNA testing.\n\n* A lot of comments below provide TMI but please keep it civil.\n\n* Go upvote some other post because it's weird this made it to the top of the sub."},
